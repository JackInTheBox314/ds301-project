Topics include: civilization, slavery, colonialism, capitalism, freedom, and justice. We approach these broadconcerns through focused engagement with African enslavement and settlement in Africa and the Americas; the development of transatlantic racial capitalism;  variations in politics and culture between empires in the Atlantic world; creolization, plantation slavery and slave society; the politics and culture of the enslaved; the Haitian Revolution; slave emancipation; and contemporary black Atlantic politics and racial capitalism.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=CORE-UA%20534

The demographic grouping of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders often seems awkward and unnatural. In considering how the histories, cultures, and politics of these groups unite and diverge, we gain a broader understanding of theformation of marginalized social identities, and how they are shaped by the forces of war, empire, capital, and social movements. We approach these questions historically, with detailed examinations of primary source documents and expressive culture.

We start by asking about the nature of moral rights and duties. What are rights, and where do they come from? How do we resolve conflicts among rights? Do animals have rights? Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We then ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or companionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy?

This involves applying concepts from metaphysics and epistemology to research in cognitive ethology and comparative psychology. We then discuss more general questions like: Are animals agents? Do they have free will? Do they live meaningful lives? Do they have moral rights? This involves applying concepts from ethics, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy to our conclusions about animal minds. Finally, we also ask, along the way, how research on animal minds can affect our philosophical theories.

Archaeology (Minor),3,ANTH-UA 132,Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways (Formerly ANTH-UA 210),,occasionally,"Although they are no longer the dominant form of human sociality oradaptation, hunter-gatherers continue to play a pivotal role inanthropological theory. But who are hunter-gatherers? Some argue that theproblem with trying to pigeon-hole hunter-gatherers is that this taxonomicunit holds little practical or evolutionary legitimacy. Others contend thatpeople have evidently lived off the land without agriculture or animalhusbandry, so at some level, hunter-gatherer is a meaningful category. Yet,few of the qualities assigned to hunter-gatherers hold up to detailedcross-cultural investigation. For example, hunter-gatherer subsistence isnot inherently linked to peaceful coexistence, affluence, small group sizesor settlement mobility. Moreover, hunter-gatherer populations commonlythought to be deeply entrenched in evolutionary time are now known toresult from complex historical processes of globalization and colonialexpansion. This course will explore the diversity of lifeways subsumedunder the banner of the hunter-gatherer. Drawing on a wide range ofcross-cultural datasets, the course will unpack hunter-gatherer behavioralvariability across broad topics, not paradigms. We will examine variationsin hunter-gatherer subsistence, mobility, social organization, beliefsystems, landscape use, and material culture. Finally, we will ask to whatdegree the concept of the hunter-gatherer and the study of modernhunter-gatherers can help anthropologists understand and explore humanbehavior in the deeper past.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=ANTH-UA%20132

Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos. The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon.

Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has garnered international attention as both the site of economic and cultural “miracles” since the 1970s and a city marked by ongoing political and social conflicts. Going beyond viewing the city as a central location for popular media production, exhibition, distribution, and consumption, this course considers Seoul as a microcosm of South Korea’s post/modern and post-colonial history and politics. The course explores the city's reflexive and reflective relationship with diverse media, spanning from newspapers and silent cinema in the early 20th century to contemporary “new” media such as VR/AR/XR, K-pop music videos, YouTube media, social media content, and more.

By focusing on one selected film per week, we will develop our own critical capacities in a way that pays attention to issues of history, politics, ideology, the material conditions of production, aesthetics, and intellectual life. We will generally follow a chronological organization and focus on important works by major directors from different parts of the Sinophone world. We will complement our critical focus on individual films with a selection of secondary readings, some of which will help to paint a broader picture of Chinese cinematic history, and some of which will provide specific readings of films through a variety of interpretive methods. The course is by no means exhaustive, and after being introduced to these several representative films and critical approaches, by the end of the semester students will hopefully be better equipped to continue navigating this rich field of cinematic production on their own.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=EAST-UA%20618

Dentistry is both a learned profession and a healing profession and as such, presents both ethical challenges and opportunities to the practitioner. Leadership cultivates a sense of agency or self-efficacy that helps immunize against the detrimental effects of stress or a loss of confidence and encourages a willingness to turn outward to help others.  Ethics offers a sure foundation for professional decision-making and an assurance that actions taken are intended for the benefit of patients—still recognizing that ethical behavior can entail ambiguities and differences of opinion. Accountability refers to a willingness to be held responsible for decisions and an ability to explain and justify them on rational grounds apart from self-interest or ulterior motives. Professionalism refers to an awareness of and a willingness to abide by the normative values and behaviors expected of all health care professionals. As we proceed through the course, distinctions will be made between the overlapping domains of legality, morality, and ethics.  We will compare and contrast the codes of ethics of the American Dental Association and the American Dentists. Whatever our own personal perspectives may be on various contentious issues of the day, entering the profession requires that ethical practitioners treat patients (and each other) with the highest level of respect and perform necessary treatments with the greatest level of expertise. “Topics in Controversy” will be presented as optional reading for personal reflection.

Indeed, so great is the magnitude of this change that we continue to term earlier thinkers “pre-Socratic philosophers.”  His stature is marked again in the name given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method.  In antiquity, importantly, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond those thinkers stretching to influence in Rome and Judea...and four centuries before the presumed time of Jesus, Socrates had already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political and religious views.  In modernity, his life both fascinates and repels the attention, notably, of Nietzsche; though criticisms of his mode of existence he had already endured in his own time at the hands of the comedian Aristophanes, among others.  Given the state of the evidence, one can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to try to recover any sense of the “historical Socrates”; but we must likewise ask whether he does not perhaps exert a greater influence as a result of the reception of the doxography itself than for his actual intellectual contributions.  In short, had Socrates never existed, would not the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy?  Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=CLASS-UA%20701

In this normative conceptualization of history, however, less attention is paid to the truth that our understanding of the past is informed by current politics and shaped within a given system of representation. This predicament, which faces all historians, is unavoidable in the study of Korean history as well, particularly because the postcolonial division of the two Koreas has conditioned the use and abuse of national history in dealing with contemporary social concerns. In reading and discussing historically significant texts along with relevant theoretical accounts, we will thus attend to the complex relationship between knowledge production and power structures, between an event and its modes of representation. Mindful of the political and epistemological questions involved in the writing and understanding of history, we will examine major events and processes that have (trans)formed modern Korean society: colonization, partition, the Korean War, industrialization, democratization, and globalization. We will also trace how people in Korea, individually and collectively, have been affected by, and have responded to, these historical changes in their everyday lives and beyond. By exploring diverse materials about modern Korean history, we will ultimately seek to locate the “national” issues being addressed—colonial domination, capitalist modernization, the Cold War, and neoliberal restructuring—within broader transnational contexts.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=EAST-UA%20609

East Asian Civilization (Minor),1,EAST-UA 618,Approaches to Chinese Cinema,,occasionally,"Beginning with one of the earliest Chinese films still in existence and ending with a 2017 blockbuster, our class will examine not only a variety of Chinese films spanning nearly a hundred years of production, but also a number of different intellectual approaches to understanding these films. By focusing on one selected film per week, we will develop our own critical capacities in a way that pays attention to issues of history, politics, ideology, the material conditions of production, aesthetics, and intellectual life. We will generally follow a chronological organization and focus on important works by major directors from different parts of the Sinophone world. We will complement our critical focus on individual films with a selection of secondary readings, some of which will help to paint a broader picture of Chinese cinematic history, and some of which will provide specific readings of films through a variety of interpretive methods. The course is by no means exhaustive, and after being introduced to these several representative films and critical approaches, by the end of the semester students will hopefully be better equipped to continue navigating this rich field of cinematic production on their own.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=EAST-UA%20618

Emphasis is placed on the political nature of the dynastic state form, the types of legitimacy and the forms of rebellion, the process of breakdown and reintegration of an imperial house, the empire as dynasty and as territory, and the range of characterology. In the second half of the course, the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber is read against the Japanese Tale of Genji. In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention is given to the role of women and marriage in a governing elite, the modalities of social criticism in a novel of manners.

We will begin with the late-Qing literature written just prior to the collapse of the imperial order with the 1911 Republican revolution. We will then turn to the work of Lu Xun, long considered the father of modern Chinese literature. We will then trace the development of modern and contemporary Chinese literature in the context of colonialism, war and revolution. Our focus will be upon how China both critically assimilates and transforms the modern concept of literature according to the specific needs of a “semi-colonial, semi-feudal” modern nation-state in the process of its formation.

While the time period will be broad, we will hope to engage in close, critical readings of significant works of fiction from a selection major authors primarily from Mainland China. How do certain concerns of modernity arise in different texts, at different times, and for different writers? What different relationships do we see being shaped between literature, life, and politics, and how does fiction negotiate certain tensions and anxieties about modern and contemporary life? By exploring a variety of engaging novels and short stories, we will hope to gain a more nuanced understanding of modern China and the role that fiction has played as both an agent of modernity and a reflection of modern Chinese life.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=EAST-UA%20732
East Asian Civilization (Minor),1,EAST-UA 735,Modern Korea & The Korean Diaspora,,occasionally,"Rather than a comprehensive history of the Korean diaspora, our study will focus on specific histories of displacement and movement out of Korea at different historical junctures, and of settling, or dwelling in Japan and the United States. Chronologically, our readings and discussion will be grouped into three periods. From 1900-1945, a period of competing colonialisms and empires in Asia/Pacific, we will look at how Koreans became racialized in Japan and the United States through institutions and structures like the labor market, with specific focus on Korean day laborers in 1920s Japan and Korean agricultural workers in Hawaii and the West Coast, and how they adopted and/or resisted identities as subjects of the Japanese empire, or as an ethnic-minority in the United States. From 1945-1990, a period of national partition, followed by the Korean War that, unending, made the Cold War especially ferocious on the Korean peninsula, we will examine specific political organizations and movements in Korea, Japan, and the United States that sought various ways of challenging U.S. hegemony in East Asia, overcoming the structure of division (both political and psychological), while at the same time challenging long-standing, structured inequalities of class and race in Japan and the United States. From 1990-present, a period of democratic transition in Korea, we will also examine the increased possibility of moving between cities like Los Angeles and Seoul not as separate spaces, but almost as a single community, in tandem with money, goods, and information. Examining various narratives (including literature and film) about experiences of displacement, and of living within or on the margins of dominant cultures in 20th century Japan and United States, we will pay attention to how identities (such as Zainichi, or Korean-American) were constituted by and against complex regimes of differentiation and homogenization along lines of race, class, gender, and sexuality.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=EAST-UA%20735

A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia.

Both the classics and the technical compendia have played important roles shaping Chinese concepts of the individual, the family, the nation, and the natural world, and have sustained these concepts through times of social turmoil and political division that have repeatedly interrupted the more stable and unified periods that tend to define the orthodox historical narrative of China’s past.

Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We then ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or companionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy?

This involves applying concepts from metaphysics and epistemology to research in cognitive ethology and comparative psychology. We then discuss more general questions like: Are animals agents? Do they have free will? Do they live meaningful lives? Do they have moral rights? This involves applying concepts from ethics, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy to our conclusions about animal minds. Finally, we also ask, along the way, how research on animal minds can affect our philosophical theories.

Taking the term “environment” in the widest sense possible (i.e., as referring to human as well as more-than-human environments), we’ll consider how environmental concerns have shaped literary innovation, and how literature has conversely come to influence environmental discourse. To this end, while tracking shifting attitudes toward “nature” and the “environment,” we’ll read foundational and lesser-known works associated with British romanticism, American transcendentalism, wilderness and conservation literature, New Deal-era progressive politics, postcolonial critique, the modern environmental movement, environmental justice, cli-fi, and eco-poetics.

That’s more deaths due to breathing bad air than from AIDS, auto accidents, cholera, malaria,  and war combined. Climate change, fossil fuels, lack of drinking water, over-population, GMOs, pollution, and the wholesale corporate campaign to discredit science are among the most critical problems of our time. Living in denial of these issues has become the West’s de facto cultural standard with only a fraction of the public taking action. How can artists, citizen-scientists, and storytellers intervene in existing narratives regarding some of humanity’s most life-threatening issues? How will you further important conversations and seize the potential to activate change?

Environmental Humanities (Minor),1,SPAN-UA 411,Mapping the Americas,,Spring,"Culturally as well as economically and politically charged ideas of space and place have been key to the mapping of the New World since the beginnings of Western colonial expansion. The ‘New World’, from this point of view, has in fact often functioned as a heterotopia of the Old. Heterotopias, in Michel Foucault’s coinage, are counter-sites that exist within the fabric of social or even natural space but that also contest, challenge and invert it. Museums, gardens and  hospitals but also boats and colonies are examples of such places that stand out from the surrounding spatial order, thus also making the latter ‘readable’ from a marginal point of view. In  the Americas, the colonial organization of space also triggered a proliferation of ‘heterotopic’ sites: from the ‘frontiers’ crossing cities and regions that render transparent the violent and contradictory foundations of American societies, to slave cemeteries and prison islands, to clandestine torture camps and strip-mined mountains. Yet heterotopias are also sites of radical  experimentation and freedom, from Thoreau’s cabin at Walden Pond to urban hangouts of  counterculture and sexual dissidence from Tango to Camp. The methodology of this course is highly participative, encouraging students to explore physical as well as virtual places and to contribute to the production of a dynamic, online-based archive of locations under analysis.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=SPAN-UA%20411

How do we position ourselves in relation to decomposers, waste-processors, potential pathogens or partners, and other hidden organisms? How are various relations with microbes and microbial processes criminalized, stigmatized or endorsed culturally and politically? Where do we situate micro-organisms in biodiversity conservation and environmental protection? How do microbes shape climate and respond to global change?In this course, we will draw from scholarship in microbial ecology, conservation science, science and technology studies, environmental humanities, and the visual arts to explore these and other questions.

Through what chemical capacities does energy create and influence the vast cultural potential for being human today? This interdisciplinary humanities and social science course will capture the significance of energy in planetary social life and thought. Specifically, we explore materialist theories of capitalism in light of current debates over planetary climate change. How does the science of radical planetary change open up new questions regarding such issues as masculinity, colonialism, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade? If slavery was an energetic system, to what extent does the end of slavery compare to the end of fossil fuels? How have theories of the human become a central feature in the organization of planetary social life? What ethics - in the Kantian sense of practical reason, that is, the capacity to know and act in uncertain and dangerous conditions - can inform our collective planetary ecology?

We trace the origins and importance of the concept of the Black Atlantic in the context of European imperial expansion and the transformation of indigenous structures of governance in the Americas, paying special attention to shifting social relations that shaped community formation among people of African descent and laid the foundations for political and economic institutions. Topics include: civilization, slavery, colonialism, capitalism, freedom, and justice. We approach these broadconcerns through focused engagement with African enslavement and settlement in Africa and the Americas; the development of transatlantic racial capitalism;  variations in politics and culture between empires in the Atlantic world; creolization, plantation slavery and slave society; the politics and culture of the enslaved; the Haitian Revolution; slave emancipation; and contemporary black Atlantic politics and racial capitalism.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=CORE-UA%20534

Traditional scholarship has stressed the role of kings in achieving unification by imposing statehood upon the territorial lords who had ruled over a society long termed feudal by influential historians (such as Marc Bloch). Modern scholars have challenged the very concept of feudalism, but do acknowledge the need to recognize France’s earlier regional units of rule, culture, and society in re-assessing the transformations of power and of economic and social structures that resulted in the late medieval emergence of France as a state. Also instrumental in this process were ideologies, myths, symbols, linguistic traits, artistic creativity, and attitudes toward those encountered either as neighbors (England, Empire, Iberian Peninsula) or as others (Jews, Muslims, Blacks, Asians), all of which all gradually fostered a self-awareness of national identity.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=HIST-UA%20920

The readings and discussion assess the virtues of the three major approaches to the phenomenon. First, a group of scholars have sought to provide a multi-causal historical explanation of neoliberalism, linking its emergence to transformations in the order of global capitalism, particularly the rise of finance capital and the expansion of extractive economies. Second, other scholars have emphasized the key role played by ideational shifts, especially the movement of once marginal economic theories forged in the 1930s into new prominence in the 1970s. A third group of scholars approach neoliberalism as a new political rationality, manifest in techniques of governance.

These empires would expand to embrace much of the globe by 1900. Empire building was a key context within which a new form of knowledge—political economy—emerged in Europe. In one sense the early modern antecedent of today’s economics, sociology, and international relations, political economy set the terms in which questions of power and prosperity were framed for most of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This course will explore the development of British and French political economy in an imperial context, focusing on key debates and controversies including seventeenth-century efforts to understand Dutch commercial success; eighteenth-century arguments about the centrality of empire to national wealth and power; and nineteenth-century critiques of colonial exploitation and metropolitan corruption entailed by empire and imperial expansionism.",CAS Graded,No,( HIST-UA 900 OR HIST-UA 910 OR HIST-UA 911 OR HIST-UA 912 OR HIST-UA 913 OR HIST-UA 914 OR HIST-UA 915 OR HIST-UA 920 OR HIST-UA 922 OR HIST-UA 924 OR HIST-UA 929OR HIST-UA 931 ).,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=HIST-UA%20445

Traditional scholarship has stressed the role of kings in achieving unification by imposing statehood upon the territorial lords who had ruled over a society long termed feudal by influential historians (such as Marc Bloch). Modern scholars have challenged the very concept of feudalism, but do acknowledge the need to recognize France’s earlier regional units of rule, culture, and society in re-assessing the transformations of power and of economic and social structures that resulted in the late medieval emergence of France as a state. Also instrumental in this process were ideologies, myths, symbols, linguistic traits, artistic creativity, and attitudes toward those encountered either as neighbors (England, Empire, Iberian Peninsula) or as others (Jews, Muslims, Blacks, Asians), all of which all gradually fostered a self-awareness of national identity.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=HIST-UA%20920

The readings and discussion assess the virtues of the three major approaches to the phenomenon. First, a group of scholars have sought to provide a multi-causal historical explanation of neoliberalism, linking its emergence to transformations in the order of global capitalism, particularly the rise of finance capital and the expansion of extractive economies. Second, other scholars have emphasized the key role played by ideational shifts, especially the movement of once marginal economic theories forged in the 1930s into new prominence in the 1970s.

In one sense the early modern antecedent of today’s economics, sociology, and international relations, political economy set the terms in which questions of power and prosperity were framed for most of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This course will explore the development of British and French political economy in an imperial context, focusing on key debates and controversies including seventeenth-century efforts to understand Dutch commercial success; eighteenth-century arguments about the centrality of empire to national wealth and power; and nineteenth-century critiques of colonial exploitation and metropolitan corruption entailed by empire and imperial expansionism.",CAS Graded,No,( HIST-UA 900 OR HIST-UA 910 OR HIST-UA 911 OR HIST-UA 912 OR HIST-UA 913 OR HIST-UA 914 OR HIST-UA 915 OR HIST-UA 920 OR HIST-UA 922 OR HIST-UA 924 OR HIST-UA 929OR HIST-UA 931 ).,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=HIST-UA%20445

We will look at the contested processes of construction and the ultimate demise of Portuguese empire and the emergence of post-colonial nation-states (starting with the independence of Brazil at the beginning of the nineteenth century) through a range of literary, artistic, musical and filmic expressions. Discussion of these materials will raise issues about the ideological underpinnings of colonialism and decolonization as well as on the diasporic memory-work individuals and communities carry out through poetry, music, and dance. The overall aim of the course is to raise sensitivity about the multiple interconnections and cross-fertilizations that sustain and enrich Luso-Brazilian cultures in the present — including, not least, the Portuguese heritage of New York City, with the foundation, in 1654, of its first Jewish congregation by exiles from Recife, Brazil, and the presence until today of sizeable Portuguese, Azorean and Brazilian communities.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=PORT-UA%20215

Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along.

Nearly 70% of justice-involved youth suffer from mental illness, yet policy regulations rob these young people of their access to education and necessary mental health care and often set them into a cycle of life behind bars. This class tells the holistic story behind the faces of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. What factors predict their involvement in criminal activity and/or contact with the system? Why are Black and Latine youth disproportionately represented in this population? Why do these children suffer such high rates of mental illness? What can be done in the interest of public health and safety to live up to the promise of justice?

Medical Humanities (Minor),1,MHUM-UA 101,Introduction to the Medical Humanities,4,,"This course introduces students to the medical humanities, an emerging field that uses the methods of humanistic inquiry to explore and challenge discourses of medicine, health, and medical science. What is a human being? How do we know when a body is healthy? How should we treat disease and injury? How are questions of individual well-being, public health and medical treatment affected by gender, race, and class? Over the course of the semester, we will examine the overlap between medical and humanistic knowledge by reading various forms of writing and rhetoric that attempt to come to terms with these questions, from Platonic dialogues about poetry and writing to colonial debates about smallpox inoculation, from Victorian medical case histories to modern prescription pads. What do we know about humans and human bodies? How do we know what we know?

An important focus of the course is an assessment of the role of policy analysis in the formation and implementation of national and local health policy. Because much of government health policy relates to or is implemented through payment systems, several sessions involve some discussion of the policy implications of how government pays for care.

Public Policy (Minor),3,UPADM-GP 226,Leadership: Women and Public Policy,,Spring,"Women have engaged and been represented in public service in America through their fearless Women's Suffrage movement to gain the right to vote, which officially began in the 19th century, in 1848, during the Seneca Falls Convention, where the first women's rights convention, was held and was triumphantly realized in the early 20th century After a hard-fought series of votes in the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, when the Nineteenth Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 20, 1920. To date, however, it is recognized, the road to elected and appointed office for women leaders is not equitable for those seeking to serve in public office. Although women make up the majority of our American population, women are the majority of registered voters and women graduate college at higher rates than men from post secondary education institutions; women are only a fraction of our elected and appointed officials. Statistics, big data analytics tell the sobering story. This course will teach offerings which underscore ""Leadership, Women and Public Service in American Cities"" charting the course and exploring the experience of women and girls in public service leadership. We will examine the context of equity for women in the structural realities and gender attitudes within the American political and civic systems. Our students will connect with women leaders and advocates for women leaders; we will teach women’s historic and contemporary participation in public service. Utilizing political and Intersection theory we will focus on trends, implications and impact of ethnicity, race, class, gender & religion on women in politics and public service. Through coursework, guest speakers and hands-on activities students will learn how they can be a participant in and influence the public agenda through public service, politics and impacting public policy.

Public Policy (Minor),3,UPADM-GP 275,Contemporary Global Crises & Humanitarian Politics,,,"In the context of a growing number of intersecting local, national, and global crises, each warranting political strategy, operational responses, and humanitarian planning across a range of states, agencies, movements, technical and political actors, this course focuses on exploring: the relationships between and among decision-makers and affected populations; the political economy of resource mobilization and distribution; the practical tools, frameworks, and blueprints used for response; questions of power in the context of emergency, and; historical determinants of humanitarian need, responsibility, and intervention. This course digs deeply into the political economy, politics, infrastructure, design, incentives, and dilemmas related to the current development and emergency paradigms, with specific exploration of what constitutes humanitarian action, aid, response, and ethics. Blending both practitioner and theoretical perspectives, this course takes a critical approach to the evolution of development concepts, slow and fast emergency, and structural inequality as they are shaped by historical events and processes, institutions, and ideologies - while simultaneously exploring the role of contemporary aid systems, political and social responses in perpetuating and remedying each. There is special emphasis on the perspectives and vantage points of people most directly affected by perpetual emergency. While not centered on or around the COVID-19 pandemic that has shaped our lives for the last three years, we will incorporate its context and reference it as an embodied case for better understanding the realities and power dynamics affecting “local populations” that we often speak about in this work, as well as a growing field of policy research and practice surrounding compounding crises, or “polycrises.”Throughout the course, which will utilize active learning modalities such as simulations, large and small group discussion, mapping and platform analysis, analysis of films, discussion of readings, guest speakers from other geographies, and individual reflection, we will engage (and often struggle with) fundamental (and technical) questions such as: • What are the political, social and economic underpinnings of contemporary development, emergency, and humanitarian discourse? • How does the design of development and humanitarian infrastructure and technical systems contribute to or alleviate structural inequality within and across societies as part of long-term development paradigms or short-term emergency response? • What does it mean to be an individual engaged in humanitarian, emergency, and development work as an affected population, as a decision-maker, as an insider or outsider? As an individual or as part of an institution? What are the historical and contemporary sources of these roles, norms, and practices? • What are the origins and starting points of an emergency? When can we say an emergency has ended? • How does a focus on underlying causes and power relations change our analysis of the problems and solutions? Should politics be removed from practice & intervention or amplified? • As people affected by an emergency are not a monolith, how can we define “local” and “sovereign” in mapping competing interests and power dynamics within communities affected by emergency? • Should we reform or abandon the current humanitarian/development aid system toward alternatives?",Ugrd Wagner Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=UPADM-GP%20275

Nearly 70% of justice-involved youth suffer from mental illness, yet policy regulations rob these young people of their access to education and necessary mental health care and often set them into a cycle of life behind bars. This class tells the holistic story behind the faces of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. What factors predict their involvement in criminal activity and/or contact with the system? Why are Black and Latine youth disproportionately represented in this population? Why do these children suffer such high rates of mental illness? What can be done in the interest of public health and safety to live up to the promise of justice? We examine these questions from a multitude of perspectives to fully understand how the system works, how it doesn’t, and what can be done to change it.

In this course, we study the doctor-patient relationship where the patient is a child – a child with family, a child with legal rights, and a child with a developing brain. We review the principles of medical ethics and the concept of informed consent, and focus on the child’s own development in her capacities to reason and make medical decisions in these contexts. We then join current debates on sexual health, psychiatric treatment, end-of-life care and research, and we raise new question about how doctor’s, kids, and families decide.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=CAMS-UA%20155

Cities have substantial power over policy areas from education and public safety to transportation, and they also address basic needs: making sure the trash gets taken out, the water runs, and that people are safe from crime. And yet, cities are often quite constrained in their policy choices. For example, one of the central challenges facing municipal government is how to attract and maintain a middle class tax base while providing essential services for low-income residents. This course will explore patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community.

We trace the origins and importance of the concept of the Black Atlantic in the context of European imperial expansion and the transformation of indigenous structures of governance in the Americas, paying special attention to shifting social relations that shaped community formation among people of African descent and laid the foundations for political and economic institutions. Topics include: civilization, slavery, colonialism, capitalism, freedom, and justice. We approach these broadconcerns through focused engagement with African enslavement and settlement in Africa and the Americas; the development of transatlantic racial capitalism;  variations in politics and culture between empires in the Atlantic world; creolization, plantation slavery and slave society; the politics and culture of the enslaved; the Haitian Revolution; slave emancipation; and contemporary black Atlantic politics and racial capitalism.",CAS Graded,No,,,https://bulletins.nyu.edu/search/?P=CORE-UA%20534

Pacific Islanders continue to fight for their sovereignty amid battles against U.S. militarism and climate catastrophe. The demographic grouping of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders often seems awkward and unnatural. In considering how the histories, cultures, and politics of these groups unite and diverge, we gain a broader understanding of theformation of marginalized social identities, and how they are shaped by the forces of war, empire, capital, and social movements. We approach these questions historically, with detailed examinations of primary source documents and expressive culture.
